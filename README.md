# SPS Suite

SPS Suite is a set of tools I developed over the years working in Oil & Gas Industry for my own use to "deal" with SPS - [Shell Processing Support Format files](https://seg.org/Portals/0/SEG/News%20and%20Resources/Technical%20Standards/seg_sps_rev0.pdf)

### This package contains:
* sps-template - tool to create template file used in other tools. This tool allow you to create templates for different versions/variations of SPS files.


### Running the tools
* system env variable SPS_SUITE_DIR that points to the suite tools folder that holds configuration files. Depend of the operating system set it up yourself.

### Disclaimer
The code style and format is as I wrote it starting in 2000 (no code reformating). ðŸ™ˆ ðŸ™‰ ðŸ™Š
